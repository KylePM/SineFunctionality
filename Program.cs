/* Purpose of this design is to show how to use BigInteger to 
 * compute the exponential function
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE: Original purpose of this project was to extend BigInteger to support
 * NaN, PositiveInfinity or NegativeInfinity.  Reading through the BigInteger 
 * documentation, it is clear that BigInteger does *not* support NaN, 
 * PositiveInfinity or NegativeInfinity
 * And, only a float or double operation in C# results in these values
 * Hence, it does not make sense in the context of C# to add NaN and both infinity
 * support to BigInteger.
 * 
 * In this program, we will use the power series to compute e^x.
 * e^x = sum(n,0,infinity)[x^n/n!]
 * 
 * Another way is to use a Lookup Table (LUT), precomputed and stored in memory:
 * Input (x)  Output (e^x)
 *     0          1
 *     0.5       1.649
 *     ...       ...
 * Advantages of the LUT:
 * O(1):  constant time access (assuming we use arrays to store the data, need to know
 *   ahead of time how many values we are storing)
 * Disadvantage of the LUT:
 * We can only return precomputed data present in the table.  
 * For example, in the table above, we can't compute e^(0.25).
 * But, the fact that we have O(1) (constant time access) is so useful that
 * a practical digital signal processing algorithm called CORDIC uses precomputed
 * lookup tables for trigonometric functions.
